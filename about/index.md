##Background

The Nationwide Search for the Ten Outstanding Boy Scouts (TOBS) of the Philippines was initiated in 1989 during the incumbency of former Education Secretary and Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP) National President Dr. Isidro D. Cari√±o. The Search aims to recognize Scouts who best represent what the Scouting program aspires to achieve: Scouts with sterling achievements in community leadership, academic excellence and good moral conduct. 

In 1993, a group of past TOBS awardees convened to jumpstart efforts in bringing together all past awardees of the annual Search.  In 1995, the group was officially organized and named Ten Outstanding Boy Scouts of the Philippines Association (TOBSPA).  Over the years, the Association evolved as a strong support organization to the BSP in the development and implementation of its relevant projects, activities and advocacies for the advancement of the Filipino youth.

Ten years after, in 2005, TOBSPA was officially recognized as a developmental arm of the BSP through a certification released by BSP Secretary General, J. Rizal C. Pangilinan.  The following year, the Association was provided an office space at the BSP National Office Field Services Division to further support its operations and maintain its close collaboration with the BSP.  

In 2010, TOBSPA celebrated its 15th anniversary led by a kick-off dinner during on January 1, 2010 during the 26th Asia-Pacific Regional Scout Jamboree in Mt. Makiling, Laguna hosted and attended by BSP National President Jejomar C. Binay.  In March of the same year, TOBSPA was officially registered as a non-stock, non-profit organization with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thus allowing the Association to strengthen its capacities as a distinct legal personality while still performing its service to the BSP and the Filipino youth.  When the BSP moved to its new National Office Building in 2011, TOBSPA also transferred to its new office at the fourth floor of the said building.    

As of 2012, the Association has 238 members in various parts of the country and abroad with diverse expertise in law, medicine, engineering, business, finance, information technology, public service, education, media and entertainment, religious ministry, military service and Scouting.
